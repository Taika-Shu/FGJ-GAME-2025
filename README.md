# FGJ-GAME-2025
We made both board game, and digital game.
In board game 2-4 players compete against each others, trying to find the big treasure. There are sharks lurking in the shadows, and octopus is guarding the treasure.
2-4 player take turns rolling the dice to move forward on the Map and see who find the treasure first .Some spaces on the map will have rewards or penalties when landed on. You may also encounter sharks or octopuses, which can block your progress or force you to start over.
In digital game the diver has three lives and one minute to find the treasure.avoid collision with shark and octopuses, as each collision will decrease one life .Collecting bubbles will increase the player's time.
